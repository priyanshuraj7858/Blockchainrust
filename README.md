1. Setting Up the Development Environment
Install Rust: Ensure Rust is installed on your development machine. This can be done using rustup for managing Rust versions.
Setup Internet Computer SDK: Install the DFINITY Canister SDK which includes dfx, the command-line tool for managing projects on the Internet Computer.
2. Smart Contract Development
Define the Smart Contract Interface: Begin by defining the structure of the smart contract that will manage the IRCRC2 token. This includes functionalities like sending tokens, receiving tokens, and checking balances.

Implement Smart Contract Logic: Write the Rust code to implement the defined interface. Ensure to handle token transfers securely, manage allowances, and update balances accordingly.

3. Testing
Unit Testing: Develop unit tests using the Internet Computer testing framework. These tests should cover all functionalities of the smart contract to ensure they behave as expected under different conditions.
4. Deployment
Deploy to Local ICP Test Network: Use dfx to deploy your smart contracts to a local instance of the Internet Computer blockchain. This allows you to test the functionality in an environment similar to the mainnet.
5. Wallet Implementation
Develop CLI for Wallet: Build a command-line interface (CLI) using Rust that interacts with the deployed smart contracts. This CLI should provide functionalities for users to send tokens, receive tokens, and check balances.
6. Security Considerations
Secure Transactions: Implement measures such as input validation, secure storage of private keys or seeds, and proper handling of transactions to prevent unauthorized access.
7. Documentation
README: Create a detailed README.md file that includes:
Setup instructions for the development environment.
Instructions for deploying smart contracts to a local ICP test network.
Usage instructions for the token wallet CLI.
Explanation of the smart contract functionalities and how they achieve the requirements.
8. Submission
GitHub Repository: Host your project on GitHub, including the Rust code for smart contracts and the token wallet CLI, unit tests, and README.md.
Submission: Submit the GitHub repository link along with any additional requested information through the specified form.
Additional Tips
Code Quality: Follow Rust best practices, such as using Result and Option types effectively, leveraging Rustâ€™s ownership model for memory safety, and ensuring code is well-commented and readable.

Security: Implement secure coding practices throughout the project, especially in handling private keys or seeds and validating user inputs to prevent vulnerabilities like injection attacks.

Communication: If you encounter technical issues or have questions, utilize the provided communication channel for assistance promptly.

By following this structured approach, you can effectively develop a secure token wallet on the ICP blockchain that meets the specified requirements and demonstrates your proficiency in Rust and blockchain development principles.
